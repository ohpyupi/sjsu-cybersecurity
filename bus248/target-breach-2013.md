# Target 2013 Breach Case

### Company Background
Target is one of the biggest retail companies in the US, competing with Amazon, Walmart and Kroger. The company suffered from a massive data breach happened in 2013. However, the company recovered its business from the breach, and still operates more than a thousand stores throughout the US. In 2019, the company was ranked as the eighth biggest retailer in the US, and it is a component of the S&P 500 Index (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation)

### Two most significant aspects of the breach
More specifically, the data breach happened for Target was the credit card data breach where customers’ credit card information has been stolen. As a consequence of the Target breach, it accelerated the adoption of chip card and PIN code for credit card payment. For example, within months of the Target breach, the executive order to accelerate the chip card adoption is signed by President Obama (Lysa Myers, 2018).

And also, the attack vector for the Target breach was the credential stolen from an HVAC supplier that has an access to Target’s network through an external vendor portal (Lysa Myers, 2018). This increased the awareness that the security of a company is not just the security infrastructure of that company, but it should consider the external vendor companies infrastructure as well. For example, if Target made sure of the security control in place for the external vendor portal, it could either stop the breach or reduce the size of it. Hence, as a consequence of Target breach, there has been a greater understanding of supply chain risk.

### What happened with the breach?
The attackers of the breach targeted the credit card information for Target’s customers from its stores all over the US. As a result, about 70 million credit cards data were stolen and exposed in the black market or dark web.

The direct cost of the breach was $252 million. And also, $4 million were used as breach-related expenses for the fourth quarter of 2014 (Jeffrey Roman, 2014).

### How/why did it happen?
The attackers did a reconnaissance over the Target’s infrastructure including its vendors, such as Microsoft virtualization software, Microsoft SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager). And the attackers were able to get access to the list of HVAC vendors of Target.

The attack started with a phishing attack to the refrigeration vendor, Fazio Mechanical, and the attack was able to install a malware to steal credentials of the Target’s vendor portal. And the attackers were eventually able to infiltrate the Target’s internal network, and they installed malware into the POS system through an automated update process. As a result of the attack, the attackers were able to steal all the credit card details from the POS systems (Aotaro Labs, 2014).

### Was the breach discovered in-house or by a third party?
The breach was detected by its security vendor software, FireEye, and Target was notified about the breach. However, there was no action taken until The Department of Justice reached out and took action against Target.

### Timeline of major events pre and post breach discovery.
The attack started around September of 2013, and initially identified by FireEye’s detection software around November in 2013. However, Target did not take any action until December 2013 until the federal agencies contacted them. Below is the timeline of the breach (Target data breach timeline, 2014 and Meagan Clark, 2014)

- September, 2013:
  - Attackers gained access to theTarget’s external vendor portal.
- November 15 - 28, 2013:
  - Attackers installed malware into the POS systems.
  - FireEye malware detection software sends out alerts.

  - FireEye malware detection software again sends out alerts.
- December 12 - 13, 2013:
  - Target is alerted by the U.S. Justice Department of suspicious activity.
  - Target meets with the Justice Department and Secret Service.
- December 14 - 19, 2013:

  - Target begins notifying payment processors and credit card providers.
  - Target confirms that credit and debit card data of 40 million customers had been exposed.
- January 10, 2014:
  - Target confirms that the data of 70 millions of customers was exposed.
- April 30, 2014:
  - Target announced that it will adopt chip-and-PIN technology for its debit and credit bard by early 2015.

### Business Impact Analysis

| Primary Damage Source| Secondary Damage Source | Actual Damage Source | Financial Exposures Type & Quantity |
|-|-|-|-|
| Operational | Loss Revenue | Down Time | Revenue Loss. Net revenue loss of $2.6 billion for 2013 Q4, compared to a $352 million profit in Q3. |
| Operational | Cost of Operations | Remediation Cost | Margin Loss. In the fiscal year of the breach, Target spent $191 million in net expense to the breach out while $46 million was covered by insurance. |
| Brand | Reputation | Reduced brand stature |Market Value Loss. The Buzz Score on YouGov dropped by 35 points to -9 on Dec. 20, 2013. And it went down further to -19 on Dec. 23, 2013. |
| Liability | Settlements | Lawsuit settlements | Target paid a $153.9 million multistate settlement in total for the breach (Vincent Lynch, 2017). |
| Operational | Cost of Operations | Increased protection costs | Margin Loss. Target estimated that it would spend $100 million to switch to the new chip-and-PIN system for the debit/credit card payment (Elizabeth Harris, 2014). |

### What measures did the company take to minimize the financial impacts of these Damage Sources. Has the company since recovered?
From the breach, there was a significant amount of margin loss incurred. Target had a cyber insurance in place prior to the breach, hence it was able to mitigate the margin loss. For example, from Target’s 2015 annual financial report, the total cost of the breach was $292 million, but the cyber insurance covered some of the costs. And the net loss result became $202 million.

Also, Target accelerated the process of chip-and PIN credit card payment system adoption. It is not necessarily related to the actual breach that happened in 2013. However, Target’s movement to secure the credit card payment process can help to minimize or recover the customer confidence loss from the breach in 2013.

When the breach was publicly announced, the stock price of Target was about $70. However, the stock price went down to less than $60. This shows that the costumes and investors lost their confidence over Target’s business competitiveness.

However, Target recovered from the breach damage. And it is still one of the biggest retail corporations in the U.S. and the stock price in 2021 is around $190.

### Was the company compliant with PCI regulations at the time of the breach? Did they comply with data breach notification laws?
Before the attackers installed malware on the Target’s internal system, Target was compliant with PCI regulations (Christian Moldes, 2018). Though PCI compliance requires security controls in place for companies, it is impossible to cover all possible attack scenarios.

It is a debatable topic on whether Target was compliant with data breach notification laws. The reason is that at the time of the breach incident, there were no standardized breach notification laws on the federal government level. And also, even if each state has the breach notification laws on their book, the guidance was vague on how quickly the public should know about the breach (Jason Rey, 2014).

### Did the company consider the incident material? Did the company comply with SEC disclosure guidance?
In Target’s 10-K filed in February 2013, the company clearly noted that cyber liability is among its risk factors. Hence, Target can argue that they already wanted shareholders that cyber incident can result in a material impact on their business operations (Lauri Floresca, 2014).

Target’s data breach was one of the first public data breach incidents after the SEC coded its disclosure guidance . And at the time of the breach, it became a test case for assessing the SEC’s disclosure guidance. As an effort to comply with the guidance, Target publicly announced the data breach, served a dedicated webpage for resources related to the breach, and offered identity theft protection to all Target customers. In the end, the SEC decided not to penalize Target for its 2013 data breach.

### Were the executives held liable? Should they have been?
Though the company did not explain the exact reason, after the breach the CEO of the company stepped down (The Associated Press, 2014), And also CIO of the company was replaced as well.

Since Target’s breach case was a relatively initial example of public data breach, the bar for the punishment and liability would have been less than that of nowadays. For example, even if the company is alerted for the breach by its vendor company, FireEye, the company did not take action promptly. This can be considered as a lack of standard of care, potentially it could have resulted in the executive-level people to be accused of the data breach.

### Target is an international company with locations in many countries. Through website sales, Target could potentially collect data about European customers. What are the high-level implications of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the company?
GDPR is a regulation created in 2016 to protect personal data of European citizens or residents. And since the credit card data is included in the definition of personal data, the GDPR regulation can be applied to the Target’s data breach incident.

GDPR clearly defines the 72-hour notification window after the company is aware of the data breach (Andy Green, 2020). If the GDPR is applied to the Target’s case, it would be pushed due to the violation of the notification time. For example, the company was first alerted to the data breach in November 2013. However, the company did not take action until December 2013.

Also, GDPR requires the company with the data breach have to report the breach to the local supervising authority. For Target’s scenario, Target could not report the case to the authority. However, the authority reached out Target for the breach. Hence, Under the GDPR, Target would be fined for the failure of report in a timely manner.
